The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species. Single origin Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available. Sustainable farming Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities. Direct sourcing Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality. Reinvest profits We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog."},{"section":"contact/index.html","title":"Swasth Help","href":"/contact/","content":"ContactDon’t fill this out: Your nameEmailMessageSend"},{"section":"products/index.html","title":"Swasth Help","href":"/products/","content":"Our CoffeeGreat coffee with a conscienceKaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it.

Plus, if you have the Client Portal enabled, your clients can log in and make payments directly from the Client Portal. The most important criteria for our seamless integration were security and pricing. Our credit card processor is fully PCI-compliant, gives you the ability to store cards securely, and saves you time because you don't have to manually enter payments. Setting up your Online Payments account Log into your Swasth account and navigate to Practice Management > Billing and Services > Online Payments and follow the steps found in this guide: Client Payments: Card processing in Swasth. What payment methods can I accept through Online Payments? With Stripe Online Payments, you can charge almost any kind of credit or debit card: • U.S. businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club. • Australian, Canadian, European, Hong Kongese, Japanese, and Singaporean businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. • Card processing fees • The integration fee for Stripe is 2.95% + $0.30 for each successful transaction - and that is across the board, whether you're running the card at the time of service or if you've stored the card to charge at your leisure. Some of our credit card processing competitors may offer a lower fee for card-in-hand transactions, but a much higher one for card-absent transactions. Our credit card processor gives you more power to make sure that you get paid for the services you provided clients, and to make sure that you get paid quickly. We care about our customers' success, and that's why we encourage the use of our credit card processor. Accessing your Online Payments account After your account has been set up, you can access your Online Payments account at any time by going to Practice Management> Billing and Services > Online Payments.

Organizational NPI: Leave this field blank unless you have a Type-2 NPI, also known as an Organization, Group, or Billing NPI. Invoices Past Due: You can select the number of days beyond which a past due designation will appear on invoices. You can also choose whether or not to email clients when an invoice is past due. Billing Address If you have multiple practice addresses or a specific billing address/P.O. Box you would prefer to use on your billing documents, you will select that address from this dropdown menu. This section also includes the toggle to enable our Unit Billing feature. Invoice Settings Invoices are the building blocks of our billing system and they allow you to bill your clients. This section allows you to choose the appointment descriptions that will display on your invoices and when to create these invoices: at the end of the day, the end of the month, or manually. Most practices choose to have invoices automatically created at the end of the day. If you collect payment at the time of the appointment, this is the best option to select. If you bill monthly, then monthly invoice creation is the best option for your practice. Automated Statement and Superbill Generation Here you have the option to pick which day of the month you'd like statements and superbills to be created for your clients as long as you have billing automations set up. We recommend choosing the 1st or 2nd day of the month if you collect payments and record them at the time of an appointment. If you collect or enter client payments after the appointment, then you will want to select a date later in the month. Billing Document Delivery Delay For your clients who receive billing documents via email or through their Client Portal, you can choose to delay the delivery of these documents. This creates a grace period between when a document is created and when it is sent, giving you time to review the document. Billing Documents for New Clients Here you can determine the default billing settings for every new client you create. AutoPay For clients that are enrolled in AutoPay, this feature automatically charges the client’s credit card that you have on file. You can enroll individual clients and disable it for others.

This document creates a financial obligation to your client alerting them that they owe you money for services or products rendered. You can only have a date of service on one invoice at a time. In Swasth, you can manually generate invoices or set up the system to auto-generate them on a daily or monthly basis. Invoices include: • Dates of service • Product add-ons • \"PAID\" designation if the entire invoice has been paid • Ability to add custom notes in the Notes section • Ability to edit service descriptions • Ability to edit Client and Provider information Statement A statement is a snapshot of the total owed by a client at any point in time. In Swasth, you can create a statement with a specified date range whenever you'd like. The statement will include any client transactions that occurred during the specified time frame, including invoices and payments. While you can create a new statement at any time, you can also choose to have Swasth automatically create invoices on a monthly basis (to be mailed, shared via the Client Portal, or emailed). Statements include: • Previous and Ending Balances for the time frame selected • Itemized Invoices detailing charges • Payments made during that time period Superbill A Superbill, also known as a Statement for Insurance Reimbursement, is a document that the therapist provides to their client for insurance reimbursement. This document is similar to a statement, but provides additional information like CPT codes and a client's diagnosis code(s). You can have Swasth generate a superbill on a monthly basis or you can choose to create them manually as needed. Superbills include: Diagnosis Code (currently only the primary code will appear) Client Insurance Information, if desired Client DOB CPT Codes and descriptors Amount charged and payments received Reimbursement Recipient Related Topics"}]
