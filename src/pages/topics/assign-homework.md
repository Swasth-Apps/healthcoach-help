  Homework can be assigned to an individual client or a group. To assign
  homework, expand the homework menu on the left menu and click on ‘Schedule’. 


  Then select an app and choose a type or category (Exercise, Lesson etc) which
  should bring a list of items for the corresponding type. Select one or more
  items, which should add them to a list on the right. Choose another type and
  do the same. You can also search for items by clicking the search icon against
  next to Module or Title.


  Once you have picked all the items for the homework click 'Assign' button.

  You can assign the homework to either an individual client or a group( you
  should have created the group first and added clients to the group). If you
  run a skills group, this can be very useful.
