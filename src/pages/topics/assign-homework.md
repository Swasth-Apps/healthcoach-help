## Assign Homework

Homework can be assigned to an individual client or a group. To assign homework, expand the homework menu on the left menu and click on ‘Schedule’. Then select an app and choose a type or category (Exercise, Lesson etc) which should bring a list of items for the corresponding type. Select one or more items, which should add them to a list on the right. Choose another type and do the same. You can also search for items by clicking the search icon against next to Module or Title.
