## Sign up

The first step of provider on-boarding is signup.

<div class="custom-alert-text"><b> Note:</b> If you already signed up to one of our mobile apps (DBT Coach, DBT Daily, CBT Companion etc.) then use a different email than what you signed up to the with. </div>

The reason you need to use a different email address is because the clinician app uses Two-Factor Authentication. We need to do for security and privacy of users' data.

## Account Confirmation

Once you sign up and verify email, we will verify your credentials and confirm your account. You will receive an email about the account being confirmed and then you can login.

## MFA Setup

The very first time, you login you will have to Set up Two-Factor Authentication (Multifactor Authentication). You will have to download Google Authenticator from [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) onto your mobile device. Then you need to set up Google authenticator. You can refer this guide. Once you set up authenticator to sync with your account, every time you login you will be asked for MFA code and you will enter the code from the authenticator app.
