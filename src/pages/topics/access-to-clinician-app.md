# Access to Swasth for Clinicians

## Sign up

The first step of provider onboarding is signup. If you already signed up for DBT Daily app, then its better to use a different email than what you signed up to DBT Daily with. If you choose to use the same email, then on the DBT Daily app when you login you will be forced to enter MFA Code. We need to do that on Swasth for Clinicians for security and privacy of users' data.



## Account Confirmation

Once you sign up and verify email, we will verify your credentials and confirm your account. You will receive an email about the account being confirmed and then you can login.

## MFA Setup

The very first time, you login you will have to Set up Two-Factor Authentication (Multifactor Authentication). You will have to download Google Authenticator from Playstore or App Store onto your mobile device. Then you need to set up Google authenticator. You can refer this guide. Once you set up authenticator to sync with your account, every time you login you will be asked for MFA code and you will enter the code from the authenticator app.
