  ## Sign up


  The first step of provider on-boarding is signup. If you already signed up for
  one of our mobile apps (DBT Coach, DBT Daily, ACT Coach etc.), then you should
  use a different email than what you signed up for that app with. The reason
  being - clinician app uses Multi-factor Authentication.


  ## Account Confirmation


  Once you sign up and verify email, we will verify your credentials and confirm
  your account. You will receive an email about the account being confirmed and
  then you can login.


  ## MFA Setup


  The very first time, you login you will have to Set up Two-Factor
  Authentication (Multi-factor Authentication).

  You can either choose to use text message (SMS) or you will have to download
  Google Authenticator from
  [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
  or [App
  Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8).
  If you choose Text Message(SMS), then you will receive a code via message
  every time you login.


  If you choose, you will have to set up Google authenticator. You can refer
  this
  [guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en).
  Once you set up authenticator to sync with your account, every time you login
  you will be asked for MFA code and you will enter the code from the
  authenticator app.
