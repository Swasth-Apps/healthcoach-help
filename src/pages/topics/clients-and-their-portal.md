Swasth for Clinicians Client Portal is an easy and secure way to engage with your clients online so that you don't have to rely on email when sharing sensitive information.

With our Client Portal, you have flexibility to: 

•	Send intake forms to clients (both new and existing)

•	Share documents and files with a client

•	Request the client's demographic information

•	Collect or update credit card info

•	Send Statements, Superbills, or Invoices 

•	Allow clients to make credit card payments through the portal (Stripe Account required)

•	Allow clients to request appointments through Swasth for Clinicians Online Booking (Professional Plan)

You'll get a unique URL that links to your unique Client Portal. You can edit this link to match your name, practice name, or whatever you'd like to display to your clients.
