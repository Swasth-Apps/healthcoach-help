  To access clients’ entry data, click on ‘Apps’ on the left navigation menu and
  pick the app that your client uses. Click the client name and you will see
  different tabs such as Entries, Exercises, Practice Ideas, Statistics etc.
  based on the app.


  This gives a holistic view of your client and you can even click on an
  individual exercise to see the answers to question on each exercise (as long
  as your client has chosen to share exercise data with you).


  The statistic tab gives an overall summary for the selected period such as
  mood chart, most common skills, behaviors, etc.


  Being able to see data at a very detailed level as well as summary helps you
  to see what is working or not and tailor your approach accordingly.
