## Assign home work to Group

To Assign homework to Group, expand the homework menu on the left menu and click on ‘Assign’. Then select an app and choose a type or category (Exercise, Lesson etc) which should bring a list of items for the corresponding type. Select one or more items, which should add them to a list on the right. Choose another type and do the same. You can also search for items by clicking the search icon against next to Module or Title.  

After that click the "Assign" button on the right side. In the select type select the Group option and list of the group will be displayed. From that select a group and click Submit button.

## View Homework

By creating a group, you can assign homework to the entire group instead of individually assigning homework to individual clients. Also we will enable messaging between members in the group in the near future (which they can opt-in or not).
