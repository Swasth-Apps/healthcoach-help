Online Payments in Swasth is an easy and seamlessly integrated way to accept credit and debit card payments from your clients. Plus, if you have the Client Portal enabled, your clients can log in and make payments directly from the Client Portal. 

The most important criteria for our seamless integration were security and pricing. Our credit card processor is fully PCI-compliant, gives you the ability to store cards securely, and saves you time because you don't have to manually enter payments. 

Setting up your Online Payments account

Log into your Swasth account and navigate to **Practice Management > Billing and Services > Online Payments** and follow the steps found in this guide: Client Payments: Card processing in Swasth.

What payment methods can I accept through Online Payments?

With Stripe Online Payments, you can charge almost any kind of credit or debit card:

•	U.S. businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club.

•	Australian, Canadian, European, Hong Kongese, Japanese, and Singaporean businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.

•	Card processing fees

•	The integration fee for Stripe is 2.95% + $0.30 for each successful transaction - and that is across the board, whether you're running the card at the time of service or if you've stored the card to charge at your leisure.



Some of our credit card processing competitors may offer a lower fee for card-in-hand transactions, but a much higher one for card-absent transactions. Our credit card processor gives you more power to make sure that you get paid for the services you provided clients, and to make sure that you get paid quickly. We care about our customers' success, and that's why we encourage the use of our credit card processor.

Accessing your Online Payments account

After your account has been set up, you can access your Online Payments account at any time by going to Practice Management> Billing and Services > Online Payments.
