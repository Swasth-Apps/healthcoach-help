You can use standardized clinical assessments such as PHQ-9, GAD-7 etc. to track how your clients are doing and adjust treatment accordingly.

## Assign Assessments

To assign assessments, expand “Assessments” on the left navigation menu. Then pick an assessment and click “Assign Client” button. In the popup, select a client, the start date and how often and then click submit. It will show up in the list of scheduled clients for that assessment.

## View Clients' Results

Once your client has taken the assessment, the results will show up in the Results sub menu. The graph indicates how the client scored each time they took the assessment.
