The programs are created with an intent to assist people in dealing with their psychological and physiological concerns and at the same time, earn monetary benefits (if the program is paid) in return of their significant help. Once you have finished creating a program, you can invite the right set of audience for availing your services. 

Primarily, there are two methods of inviting users to join your program- Inviting users, and by accepting the requests sent by clients. 

In this chapter, we are going to walk you through both of these ways of creating the client base.

## Invite users to join Program

As a coach, you may have a list of past clients that you would like to invite for joining the program. To invite the users, coaches need to have the users’ email id. 

The coach will have to click on the invite button, as shown in the image.

After that, a screen with the email id and message will popup. The coach now has to enter the user’s email address and a relevant message stating their cause. 

With this in-app functionality, the coach can retain their past clients along with creating new ones. 

## Approve join requests

The second method of increasing the user base is by approving join requests by clients.

These requests are directed to the coach side for further processing. The coach can either approve or decline these requests, as per their convenience.

The coaches can also mark 'Close to new requests' when the particular cohort is full, or they don’t wish to accept any more clients.
