The programs are created with an intent to coach people and earn some monetary benefit (if the program is paid). Once you’re done creating a complete program, then it’s time to invite the right set of audience for availing your services. 

Primarily, there are two methods of inviting users to join your program- Inviting users, and by accepting the requests sent by clients. 

In this chapter, we are going to walk you through both of these ways of creating the client base.

## Invite users to join Program

As a coach, you may have a list of past clients that you would like to invite for joining the program. To invite the users, coaches need to have the users’ email id. 

The coach will have to click on the invite button, as shown in the image.

After that, a screen with the email id and message would popup. The coach will have to enter the user’s email address and a relevant message stating their cause. 

With this in-app functionality, the coach can retain their past clients along with creating new ones. 

## Approve join requests

The second method of increasing the user base is by approving join requests. Clients while browsing programs send requests for the program (and cohort) they wish to get enrolled in. 

These requests are directed to the coach side for further processing. The coach can either approve or decline these requests as per their convenience.

The coaches can also mark, closed to new requests when the particular cohort is full, or they don’t wish to entertain any more clients.
