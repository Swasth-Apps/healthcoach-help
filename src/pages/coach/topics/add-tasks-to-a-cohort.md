Tasks are the set of activities that are prescribed to clients throughout the program. After a session is taken, coaches assign a set of activities based on individual sessions, like logging your emotions, practicing meditation, etc. regularly. Usually, the tasks are added in the program itself. However, sometimes a coach would like to add some tasks in a specific cohort as per the requirements. This feature helps in catering to the same. 

## How to add sessions in a cohort?

To add tasks in a cohort, you have to select the cohort and go to the tasks tab. Click on “add tasks“ and the app would redirect you to add Tasks page as shown in the image.

There you will have to add the following details as mentioned below-

* Input your task name, and add repeats (daily, monthly, none, weekly).
* Mention the task type, for instance, breathing exercise, or free form
* Mention Time at which the user would have to begin the task
* Add the day from the start, and a brief description of the task
* Go ahead, press “continue” and unfold a new task in front of your clients.
