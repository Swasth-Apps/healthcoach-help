## What is a program?

A program is a series of lessons, tasks, exercises, followed by homework sessions that run over some time. 

Aligning with your clinician practice, clients can sign up for your program and learn to deal with their issues via this comprehensive platform. 

You can choose to enrich your program with the help of your Library, or add content from the apps- CBT Companion, ACT Coach, DBT Coach, and foster evidence-based therapies. 

## How to Create a Program?

Creating a program is primarily a four-step process, later sections will enlist how to avail all the features to complete a program-

1. Name
2. Details
3. Payment
4. Confirm

In the first step, you need to enter an easy-to-understand name of the program, followed by a brief description of the same.

The second step will require you to enter the number of clients that are going to be entertained in a session. 

Add the duration of a session, additional documents, tags and the relevant app to use from our Library to complete this stage.

In the third step, mention the type of entity, mobile number, email id to set up your payment account. Once done, add the verification code sent on your device for securing your account.

Once you’ve successfully connected with Stripe, you can choose to offer your services for free, or paid. If you choose the latter, set the price that your clients will have to pay to enroll in your program.

Lastly, there is a confirmation stage, where you can change the duration of the program, payable amount, tags, apps to use and confirm it to get started.

Now, you’re done creating the basic version of your program. However, the process doesn’t end here. The next set of guides will help you in adding tasks, sessions, cohorts, setting up libraries, and many more to create a fully-fledged program for your clients.
