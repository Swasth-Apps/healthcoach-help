## What is a program?

A program is a series of lessons, tasks, exercises, followed by homework sessions run over some time. Aligning with your clinician practice, clients can sign up for your program and learn to deal with their issues via this comprehensive platform. You can choose to enrich your program via your library, or add content taken from three apps (CBT Companion, ACT Coach, DBT Coach) and easily bring evidence-based therapies to your clients. 

## How to Create a Program?

Creating a program is primarily a four-step process, later sections would enlist how to avail all the features to complete a program-

1. Name
2. Details
3. Payment
4. Confirm

In the first step, you need to enter an easy-to-understand name of the program, followed by a brief description of the same. 

The second step would require you to enter the number of clients that are going to be entertained in a session. Add the duration of a session, additional documents, tags and the relevant app to use from our library to complete this stage. 

In the third step, mention the type of entity, mobile number, email id to set up your payment account. After that, you need to add the verification sent on your device for securing your account. Once you’ve successfully connected with Stripe, then you can choose to offer your services for free, or paid. If chosen later, then mention the price your clients will have to pay for your program and start getting paid for services. 

Lastly, there is a confirmation stage, and here you can change the duration of the program, payable amount, tags, apps to use and confirm it to get started. 

Now, you’re done creating the basic version of your program. However, the process doesn’t end here. The next sets of guides help you in adding tasks, sessions, cohorts, setting up libraries, and much more to create a fully-fledged program for your clients.
