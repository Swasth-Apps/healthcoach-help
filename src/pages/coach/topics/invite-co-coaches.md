Co-Coaching is a feature that allows the coaches to invite other coaches to assist them in running the Program. The co-coach can be invited for the following reasons-

* If the leading coach is only available for sessions and can’t respond to individual queries.
* If the main coach decides to take-off from clients, the co-coach can help in running the specific program from that time.
* The co-coach is an intern or learner who wishes to acquire in-hands experience to enrich their learning base.

* The app will present you with three options- Add Co-Coach, Edit Program, and Delete Program.

* You can also search for coaches with their name, practice, and tags using the search bar.
* Once you’ve finalized the co-coach, click on the invite button. 
* A request will be sent to that coach, following which he/she can either accept or reject it, based on their preferences. 
* When the co-coach accepts or rejects your invitation, you will receive a notification for the same.
