Co-Coaching is a feature that allows the coaches to invite other coaches to assist them in running the Program. The co-coach can be invited for the following reasons-

* If the leading coach is only available for sessions and can’t respond to individual queries.
* If the main coach decides to take-off from clients, to continue running the Program, the co-coach can help.
* The co-coach is an intern or learner who needs the assistance of an expert for enriching their learning base.

* You can also search for coaches with their name, practice, and tags using a search bar.
* Once you’ve finalized the individual you would like to invite, click on the invite button. 
* Further, the request would be sent to the second person, and he/she can either accept or reject it based on their preferences. 
* When the co-coach accepts or rejects your invitation, you will receive a notification informing you the same.
