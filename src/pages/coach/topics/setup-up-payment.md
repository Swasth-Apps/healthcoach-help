This feature requires you to set up your payment account for getting paid for your services. As a coach, you may choose to offer programs for free or paid. In case you have chosen later, then you need to integrate your account with the app for smooth operations. In this chapter, we are going to walk you through the steps for adding your payments details. 

## How to add Payment Details?

1. Go to your profile ( the rightmost icon available on the bottom of the screen).
2. Click on the payment details card, from there you will be redirected to the payments page (Connect Stripe).
3. Select your entity type- Company, Non-Profit Organization, or an individual/sole proprietor /single-member LLC.

1. Then enter your mobile number for verifying your account, click next.
2. The app will send a verification code on the registered mobile number. Enter that verification id and proceed to the next stage. You can also choose to resend the code, in case the previous one wasn’t received on your device. Also, the app gives you an option to change the mobile number by clicking “use a different mobile number”.
3. Once verified, you need to enter the legal name of the person (although this would be automatically taken from the app, however, you can change it here)
4. Then, add the link of your business website, business social media profile, or link to a product description in the business website box, click next.
5. The next page will require you to fill your payout details, i.e.where you’d like to receive your payouts- Bank Account or Debit Card.
6. If chosen bank account, then you need to input Routing Number, Account Number followed by confirming account number card. Once done, hit on the Save button.
7. In case you have opted for a debit card, the app would request your card number and expiration date. Once filled, hit on the Save button.
8. The last step is the confirmation stage. There you can edit your business and management information followed by payout details. Once confirmed, hit done and you’ll be finished completing your payment setup.
