## What is a Library?

![My Library](/img/my-library.png "My Library")

The Library is a personalized workspace that a coach can create by adding relevant links, documents, and images for enriching the program. A coach can also get the content from our three apps- CBT Companion, ACT Coach, and DBT Coach for adding in the program. 

## To create your library-

* Add links relevant to your practice and program
* Add images from your device, or uploads.
* Add documents from device, or uploads.
