Cohorts are sets of modules/sessions running at different times. The coaches add these cohorts for delivering the program, as per their convenience.

Coaches decide the upper limit of the number of clients who can enroll in an individual cohort. 

For instance, if a coach decides to accept only eight clients, new members cannot join the cohort once the maximum limit has been reached.

Clients can choose a cohort for joining the program from the available items.
