Cohorts are different sets of batches running at different times. The coaches add these cohorts for delivering the program as per their convenience.

Coaches decide an upper limit of the clients for an individual cohort. For instance, if a coach decides to take eight clients in a cohort, then after that, eight clients are finalized, the particular cohort would be closed for new clients. 

Clients can select the cohort for joining the program from the available items.
