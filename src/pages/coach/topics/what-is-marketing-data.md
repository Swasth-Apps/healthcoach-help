The question here isn’t how, but why!

_Why should a user select your program? The answer here is pretty simple- because of the attractive features!_

Marketing is all about promoting your program by presenting the best features of your program backed up by your expertise. 

Marketing data are different pieces of information about the program that helps in attracting clients. Marketing data includes-

* A video URL, giving an overview of the program and related concepts. 
* The description is used for stating the objective of a program in one or two lines.
* “What you will learn” section that lists all the concepts that are going to be taught to clients. Here, the coach needs to mention the exclusive learnings that a program has to offer apart from the regular ones to attract the client better. 
* Coach Info section where the coach enlists details about their profession, interest, hobbies, and education, in addition to a simple bio. 

This feature helps in attracting the user to your program, broadening your client base, and eventually boost the monetary return (if you’ve marked the program paid). 

Hence, make sure you make the most out of this in-app functionality.
