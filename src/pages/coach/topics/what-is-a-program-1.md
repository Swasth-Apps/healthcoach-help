A program is a series of lessons, tasks, exercises, followed by homework sessions run over some time. Aligning with your clinician practice, clients can sign up for your program and learn to deal with their issues via this comprehensive platform. You can choose to enrich your program via your library, or add content taken from three apps (CBT Companion, ACT Coach, DBT Coach) and easily bring evidence-based therapies to your clients.
