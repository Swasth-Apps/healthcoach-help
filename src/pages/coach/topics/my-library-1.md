## What is My Library?

The library is a personalized workspace that you can use for saving relevant images, documents, and links. 

During your journey as a coach, you might come across various pieces of information that you would like to save for future usage. Down the line, you can access all these saved pieces in creating your program. 

Health Coach is integrated with CBT Companion, DBT Coach, ACT Coach apps, and you can also enrich your program with the content provided in these applications in addition to the library content.
