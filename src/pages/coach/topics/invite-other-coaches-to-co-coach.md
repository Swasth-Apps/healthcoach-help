Co-Coaching is a feature that allows the coaches to invite other coaches to assist them in running the program. The co-coach can be invited for the following reasons-

* If the leading coach is only available for sessions and canâ€™t respond to individual queries.
* If the main coach decides to take-off from clients, to continue running the program, the co-coach can help.
* The co-coach is an intern or learner who needs the assistance of an expert for enriching their learning base.
