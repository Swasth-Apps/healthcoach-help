## What is a session?

Sessions are a set of interaction modules between the client and coach accompanied by tasks, homework exercises required to complete a program successfully.

Depending upon the flexibility of both parties, sessions can be either in-office or video. These sessions make up for the primary chunk of the program.

## Types of sessions

The sessions usually are of two types- In-office and Video. Going by their titles, in-office sessions are conducted in the coach’s office, whereas video sessions take place with the help of video calls. 

When a session is marked video, both the coach and the client will be notified of the session, 15 minutes before it begins.

However, both types of scheduled sessions show up in the calendar, as we have discussed before.

## Add Sessions

In the above sections, we discussed the basics of a session. In this chapter, we are going to walk you through the step-by-step guide of “how to add a session?” 

To add a session in a program, go to the content tab, click on the “Add sessions,” the app will redirect you to add sessions page as shown in the image.

There you will have to add the following details as mentioned below-

* **Module Name**- Module is a set of sessions based on specific skills from a group, under any of the three evidence-based therapies - DBT, CBT or ACT. For instance, Emotion Regulation. 
* **Module Image**- The image that is going to be used as a background for each module.
* **Repeats**- It is the frequency at which each module is repeated through various sessions. In total, four types of repeat frequencies are imbibed in the app- none, daily, weekly, monthly. 
* **Prefix Name**- This is the name of the individual session that is part of a module. Take, for example, if your module name is Emotion Regulation which is weekly repeated, and the prefix name is self-harm, then the final prefix name would be self-harm for week 1, self-harm for week 2, etc. However, later in the journey, this prefix name can be edited using “Edit Session.”
* **No. of days from start**- This number indicates the digit of the first day of each session of a specific module. For example, if a client enrolls in a program with weekly sessions, Day from Start would be 1,7,15,22...
* **Description**- Add a brief description of the session; however, this section is entirely optional.

## Add Content in Session

You can choose to add learning materials and homework for sessions via the library. The library is equipped with links, documents, and images that can help in enriching the program. 

You can also add contents available in the apps (DBT Coach, CBT Companion, and ACT Coach) that are integrated into the application. 

These apps provide myriad of contents, such as exercises, meditation, lessons, and practice ideas for complementing your program.

## Edit Session

Edit session is an in-app functionality availing which the coach can edit the details of a session after the creation of the same. 

Whether you want to change the name of a session, or some other piece- Edit Sessions come handy.
