As discussed in previous chapters, there are two ways of inviting users to join your program- Inviting users, and by accepting the requests sent by clients. In this section, we are going to discuss how to invite users to join a specific cohort. 

## How to invite users to join  a cohort?

As a coach, you may have a list of past clients that you would like to invite for joining the program. To invite the users, coaches need to have the users’ email id. 

The coach will have to click on the invite button, as shown in the image. After that, a screen with the email id and message would popup. The coach will have to enter the user’s email address and a relevant message stating their cause. With this in-app functionality, the coach can retain their past clients along with creating new ones.
