## How to invite users to join a cohort?

As a coach, you may have a list of past clients that you would like to invite for joining the program. To invite the users, coaches need to have the users’ email id. 

Click 'Invite' and the app will request the user's email id.

Enter the user’s email address and a relevant message stating their cause. 

With this in-app functionality, the coach can retain their past clients, along with new ones.
