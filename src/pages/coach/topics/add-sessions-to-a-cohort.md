In the past chapters, we have covered how to add sessions in a program. However, the app also supports creating sessions for individual cohorts. 

The most important thing to understand here is that the session created for this cohort will not be reflected in other cohorts of the same program. That implies, these sessions are specific to the cohort and are not generalized.

## How to add sessions in a cohort?

To add sessions in a cohort, you have to select the cohort and go to the sessions tab. Click on “add sessions” and follow these steps to accomplish the process-

* **Module Name**- Module is a set of sessions based on specific skills from a group, under any of the three evidence-based therapies - DBT, CBT or ACT. For instance, Emotion Regulation. 
* **Module Image**- The image that is going to be used as a background for each module.
* **Repeats**- It is the frequency at which each module is repeated through various sessions. In total, four types of repeat frequencies are imbibed in the app- none, daily, weekly, monthly. 
* **Prefix Name**- This is the name of the individual session that is part of a module. Take, for example, if your module name is Emotion Regulation which is weekly repeated, and the prefix name is self-harm, then the final prefix name would be self-harm for week 1, self-harm for week 2, etc. However, later in the journey, this prefix name can be edited using “Edit Session.”
* **No. of days from start**- This number indicates the first day of each session of a specific module. For example, if a client enrolls in a program with weekly sessions, Day from Start would be 1,7,15,22...
* **Description**- Add a brief description of the session; however, this section is entirely optional.
