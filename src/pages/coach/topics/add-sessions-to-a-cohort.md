In the past chapters, we have covered how to add sessions for a program in detail. However, the app also supports creating sessions for individual cohorts. 

The most important thing to understand here is that the session created for this cohort will not be reflected in other cohorts of the same program. That implies, these sessions are specific to the cohort and are not generalized.

## How to add sessions in a cohort?

To add sessions in a cohort, you have to select the cohort and go to the sessions tab. Click on “add sessions” and follow these steps to accomplish the process-

* **Module Name**- Module is a pack of sessions that are going to occur on a regular interval, for instance, Meditation. 
* **Module Image**- The image that is going to be used as a background for the module.
* **Repeats**- it is the frequency of session repetition. In total, four types of repeat frequencies are imbibed in the app- none, daily, weekly, monthly. 
* **Prefix Name**- This is the name of the individual session that is part of a module. Take, for example, your module name is Meditation, repeats are weekly, and prefix name is depression. Then the final prefix name would be depression for week 1, depression for week2, etc. However, later in the journey, this prefix name can be edited with the “edit session.”
* **No. of days from start**- This number indicates the day from the start of the program by the client when he/she would be asked to do this session. For instance, if 3 is the day from the beginning, and the client enrolls in the program on October 3, then October 5 would be the first day from the start when this session is going to begin. 
* **Description**- Add a brief description of the session; however, this section is entirely optional.
