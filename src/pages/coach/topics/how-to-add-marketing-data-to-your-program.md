We have already discussed these individual sections in the previous chapter; however, in the chapter, we are going to dive into details and support the guide with some examples.

**1. Video URL**

A video URL, giving an overview of the program and related concepts. 

For instance, your Program name is “DBT Skills Training.” Then the URL can be a youtube video of “DBT Coach” app or “what is DBT?” This will help the users who are a bit new to the coaching understand the therapies before signing up for the program.

**2. Description**

The description is used for stating the objective of a program in one or two lines. Going by the above example, if your program is “DBT Skills Training”, then description can be something like-

“Online learning makes it easy and affordable to begin implementing DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skills in your life without waiting.”

**3. What you'll learn**

“What you will learn” section lists all the concepts that are going to be taught to clients. Here, the coach needs to mention the exclusive learnings that a program has to offer apart from the regular ones to attract the client better.  

* Create greater self-awareness
* Increase your ability to regulate your emotions
* Deal with life stressors that are unbearable
* Interact with people more effectively
* Know how to make changes to your life.

\-are some of the objectives that can be enlisted in the “What you’ll learn?” section.

Coach Info section where the coach log details about their profession, interest, hobbies, and education, in addition to a simple bio.
