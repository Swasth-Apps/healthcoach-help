When you have joined a program, there will be a lot of activities. A program is supplemented with a series of tasks, lessons, sessions, and homework assignments. To complete the program successfully, you need to finish all these things timely. Some of them require daily attention, and others may occur once in a week or so. The business has become our nature, and we all need a little reminder to accomplish our goals. Sometimes out of habit, or jammed up routines, the clients may forget the approaching session or scheduled task. Addressing this issue, Health Coach has been equipped with a user-friendly, robust calendar that will enlist all your upcoming sessions and tasks.
