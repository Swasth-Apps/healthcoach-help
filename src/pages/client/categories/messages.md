Effective communication is key to any kind of therapy. To ensure a successful treatment, coaches and clients need to have a strong relationship with elements of motivation and honesty. 

Health Coach allows users to maintain a seamless connection through texts, videos and documents. Clients can send messages to their coaches, or other clients who are part of the same cohort via the app. 

Whether you have some quick questions to ask from your coach or want to share a personal experience, our 24X7 message feature is one of the fastest and most convenient ways to interact.

Health coach offers two types of messaging services to the users- 
Direct & Group.
