## What is My Library?

The library is a personalized workspace that a client can use for saving relevant images, documents, and links. During your journey as a client, you can save different pieces of information for future usage. Down the line, if you wish to sign as a coach, then you can access all these saved pieces in creating your program. Health Coach is integrated with CBT Companion, DBT Coach, ACT Coach apps, and you can also enrich your program with the content provided in these applications in addition to the library content.
