## What is My Library?

The library is a personalized workspace that a client uses for saving relevant images, documents, and links. 

During your journey as a client, you can save different pieces of information for future usage. 

Down the line, if you wish to sign up as a coach, you can access all the saved pieces in creating your program. 

Health Coach is integrated with CBT Companion, DBT Coach, ACT Coach apps that has myriad of lessons and exercises. You can enrich your program further with the help of these applications.
