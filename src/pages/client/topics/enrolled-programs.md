A program is a series of lessons, tasks, exercises, followed by homework sessions run over some time. Based on your requirements, you can choose to sign up for tailored programs and learn to deal with issues via this comprehensive platform.

A user may enroll in multiple programs. The dashboard helps in keeping tracking of all the programs by enlisting them, as shown in the image. Click on the dashboard icon and check the Enrolled Programs card present on the screen for viewing programs.
