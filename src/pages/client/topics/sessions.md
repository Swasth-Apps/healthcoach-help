Sessions are the set of interaction modules between the client and coach accompanied by tasks, homework exercises for completing the program over a period of time. These sessions can be either in-office or video as per the flexibility of both parties. 

A program involves sessions from time to time. A calendar will help you to check all the scheduled sessions in the upcoming days. To check all your past and future sessions, click on the Calendar tab present at the bottom of the screen. The calendar will enlist all the activities that are scheduled for the day. Also, with the left and right scrolling arrow, you can view the past and future sessions, respectively.

Not only this, but you can also view the upcoming session- day, date, and time on the dashboard. With this, you can better plan your days and never miss any activity.
