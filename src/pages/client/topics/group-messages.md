Coaches can create groups based on different cohorts of a program. These groups provide all the members belonging to a specific cohort of a platform to interact. Members can share their experience, ask questions, and engage in meaningful conversations with other clients. The primary intent behind this functionality is to create a community of the people undergoing a similar situation. This way, a person may not feel alone in the journey, which will also help in boosting their progress. 

 To send messages in a group-

* Select on the Messages tab present at the bottom left.
* Click on the Group Message as shown in the screen
* Check all the groups that your coach has created
* Select the group where you want to send messages.
* Hit on the chat tab, and share what goes in your mind.

The app also supports sharing images and videos. You can click on the “+” (add icon) present on the bottom left of the screen. Upload the photo or video you wish to share with the group. 

Many times you may have to search a message or group, but aren’t unable to because of the massive amount of data. Hence, to simplify your search, a search bar is placed on the top, as shown in the image. Enter the group/message you would like to search, and the app will present the filtered data based on your search query.
