You can look up for different programs by adding the relevant tags in the search bar offered by coaches.  Also, there are some programs that are marked featured. 

![Client profile](/img/client-profile-i.png "Client profile")

The admin sets the list of featured coaches and programs based on their experience, client reviews, successfully completed programs, etc. So, as to search them, go to my profile and click on the star icon present at the top right corner, as shown in the above image. There you will have a list of featured coaches and programs.

The programs are both paid and unpaid. If the program of your choice is paid, then you need to pay the amount mentioned by the coach. 

Programs are equipped with many cohorts; after selecting the program, you need to choose the suitable cohort for joining the program from all the cohorts available. Select the right cohort, pay the mentioned amount, and start learning.
