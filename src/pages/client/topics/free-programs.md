A coach can create free or paid programs as per their choice. 

To join an unpaid program, enter the relevant tag in the search bar and check out all the related programs offered by different coaches. Also, there are some programs that are marked featured. 

![Client Profile](/img/client-profile-i.png "Client Profile")

The admin sets the list of featured coaches and programs based on their experience, client reviews, successfully completed programs, etc. 

So, as to search them, go to my profile and click on the star icon present at the top right corner, as shown in the above image. 

There you will have a list of featured coaches and programs.

The programs that arenâ€™t listed paid can be filtered for joining. 

Programs are equipped with many cohorts; after selecting the program, you need to choose the suitable cohort for joining the program from all the cohorts available. 

Select the cohort, and you will be enrolled in the program.
