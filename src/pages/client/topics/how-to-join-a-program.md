You can join a program starting with searching by program name via the search bar. Once youâ€™ve stumbled upon the right program, you can send the joining request to a coach. 

There is an alternate option of selecting programs by searching coaches via the search bar. There you will have a detailed list of all programs provided by the specific coach.
