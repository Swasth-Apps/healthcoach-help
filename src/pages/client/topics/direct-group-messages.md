Clients can send direct and group messages to coaches and other clients. 

Direct Messages are initiated by the coaches for conversing with clients on an individual basis. On the other hand, Group Messages are for separate cohorts. A client can interact and share their queries with other clients part of the same cohort. These groups are also created by the coach who created the respective cohort.
