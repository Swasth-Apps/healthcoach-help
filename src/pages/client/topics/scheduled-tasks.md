Tasks are the set of activities that are prescribed to clients throughout the program. There are different types of tasks- Free Forms, Diary Entries, and Breathing Exercises that a client has to perform from time to time for completing the program successfully. To check all your scheduled tasks, click on the Calendar tab present at the bottom of the screen. The calendar will enlist all the activities that are scheduled for the day. Also, with the left and right scrolling arrow, you can view the past and future tasks, respectively.

Not only this, but you can also view the scheduled task- day, date, and time on the dashboard. With this, you can better plan your days and never miss any activity.
