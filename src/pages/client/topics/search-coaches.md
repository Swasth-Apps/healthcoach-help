Clients can search for different coaches offering programs with the help of a search icon present at the top right corner. 

You can look up for the coaches by either inserting practice names (CBT Coach), tags (Meditation) or the name of the coach itself (say, Sara Edelman) and it will display all relevant items matching your search input. 

Also, you can click on the mentor button to filter mentors from regular coaches.
