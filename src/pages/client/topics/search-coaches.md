No application is complete without the presence of a search bar. Health Coach is a coaching platform designed to ease your engagement with the therapists for improving your overall health (mental, physical, social, nutrition, etc.) Using the platform, coaches can provide tailored programs that lead to better outcomes. Clients can search for different coaches offering programs with the help of a search icon present at the top right corner. You can look up for the coaches by either inputting practice names (CBT Coach), tags (Meditation) or the name of the coach itself (say, Sara Edelman). 

Also, you can click on the mentor button to filter mentors from regular coaches.
