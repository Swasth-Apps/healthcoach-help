Direct Messages are for one-to-one conversations between coaches and clients. 

A coach/client can initiate dialogue with the other party for discussing the progress of a program or related things. Clients can raise a query or describe any issue they are facing on an individual level. 

Direct Messages offer a private channel to the client and coach where they can discuss the client’s issues. 

If any topic or sub-topic has not been covered in a session or the client desires to seek revision, it can be shared through this feature.

To send direct messages-

* Select on the Messages tab present at the bottom left
* Click on the Direct Message as shown in the screen
* Select the user you want to message
* Hit on the chat tab, and interact freely

The app also supports sharing images and videos. Click on the “+” (add icon) present on the bottom left of the screen. Upload the photo or video you want to share with your coach/client. 

A search bar is located at the top. Enter any group name/message you want to search, and you will be presented with the filtered data based on your search query.
