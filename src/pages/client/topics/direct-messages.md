Direct Messages are for one-to-one conversations between coaches and clients. A coach/client can initiate dialogue with the other party for discussing the progress of a program or related things. Clients can share their queries or any obstacle they are facing on an individual level. Direct Messages offer a private channel between the client and coach where they can discuss the client’s issues. Also, when something has not been covered in a session or any other information that the client wishes to seek, can be shared via this channel.

To send direct messages-

* Select on the Messages tab present at the bottom left.
* Click on the Direct Message as shown in the screen
* Select the user you want to message.
* Hit on the chat tab, and interact freely.

The app also supports sharing images and videos. You can click on the “+” (add icon) present on the bottom left of the screen. Upload the photo or video you wish to share with the second party. 

Many times you may have to search a message or group, but aren’t unable to because of the massive amount of data. Hence, to simplify your search, a search bar is placed on the top, as shown in the image. Enter the group/message you would like to search, and the app will present the filtered data based on your search query.
