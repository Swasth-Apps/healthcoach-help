The foundations of Health Coach lays on the concept of Behavioral Health Coaching, which is based on research and evidence. Both the parties (clients and coaches) will use a proven system that increases your chances of implementing behavioral changes that are going to last a lifetime. Our coaches use the principles of Evidence-based therapies (DBT, CBT, ACT) for altering the clientsâ€™ actions, reactions, and behavioral patterns.
